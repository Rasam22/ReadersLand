Enjoying a meteoric rise to the top of society, his wit, humour and intelligence shine through his plays and writings. However, due to his sexuality, he suffered the indignity and shame of imprisonment. For a long time, his name was synonymous with scandal and intrigue. However, with changing social attitudes, he is remembered with greater affection for his biting social criticism, wit and linguistic skills.His fame as a dramatist began with the production of Lady Windermere's Fan in February 1892. His next comedy was A Woman Of No Importance, produced on 19th April 1893 at the Haymarket Theatre in London by Herbert Beerbohm Tree. It repeated the success of Lady Windermere's Fan, consolidating Wilde's reputation as the best writer of \"comedy-of-manners\" since Richard Brinsley Sheridan.  A slightly more serious note was struck with An Ideal Husband, produced by Lewis Waller at the Haymarket Theatre on 3 January 1895. This contains a political melodrama\u2014as opposed to the marital melodrama of the earlier comedies\u2014running alongside the usual Wildean Epigrams, social commentary, comedy, and romance.Barely a month later, his masterpiece The Importance Of Being Earnest appeared at the St James's Theatre.

Rabindranath began writing from an early age and impressed with his free-flowing style and spontaneous compositions. He mostly rejected formal schooling; he spent much time being taught at home. After returning to India, in 1901, Tagore moved to Shantiniketan to found an ashram which became his focal point for writing and his view on schooling. He chose the name for the ashram \u2013 Shantiniketan meaning \u2018Abode of Peace\u2019.In 1913, Tagore was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature for his work \u2018Gitanjali\u2018 This made his writings internationally known and his fame spread throughout the world. This gave Tagore the opportunity to travel extensively giving lectures and recitals in many different countries.Tagore had a great love for nature and many of his poems invoke the simple beauties of the natural world. For Tagore, his religion could be found in the wonders and mysteries of nature \u2013 as much as in temples and sacred books.Tagore is unique for being the official composer for the national anthem of two countries \u2013 India\u2019s Jana Gana Mana and Bangladesh\u2019s Amar Shonar Bangla.In 1919, Tagore returned his knighthood in protest at the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, in which many peaceful Indian protesters were killed.", "knowmore": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindranath_Tagore" } },
